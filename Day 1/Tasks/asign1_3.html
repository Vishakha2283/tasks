    <h2>About Kerala :</h2>
    <p>
        The term Kerala was first epigraphically recorded as Cheras (Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka of Magadha. It was mentioned as one of four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being the Cholas, Pandyas and Satyaputras.
        Kerala is one of the small states of India in terms of area. it consists of only 1.3 per cent of the total area of India. The state is located in the southwest corner of India. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu bound it on north, east and south and on east by the Arabian Sea.

Cantilevered Chinese fishing nets, typical of Kochi, have been in use for centuries.</p>
